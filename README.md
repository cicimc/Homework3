## Homework 3

# Password Generator

# Added Changes
I added different characters/Arrays for what can go in a password. Then I made sure to make a varible for the user input. Made a function to generate the password. In that function I created confirmation messages for the user to choose what they want in the password. Made sure to have a limit on how many characters the user is able to have. To make sure everything was added for the users new password I used Math.floor and Math.random. This will make sure the password will come out randomly with different characters each time. I used the If and Else statements throughout the script.js. 

# Key Things
What I used:
* var Characters
* var userInput
* Function to generate a password
* If, else, while, and for statements
* An alert message to let the user know to choose a character
* Confirmation messages for the user to choose what characters to use
* Concat to join 2 or more strings
* Made sure the length can't be no more than 128 and no less than 8
* A prompt and alert for if the user does not choose how long they want their password to be
* Making sure any of the characters that the user chooses are added in. (allUserInput)
* var newPassword 
* Math.floor and Math.random
* return newPassword.join (adding all elements of an array into a string)
